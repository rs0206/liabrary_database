Library Management Database System 📚💻
This project is a relational database system designed to efficiently manage a library's membership, inventory, and borrowing records while ensuring data integrity, privacy, and security. The database follows 3rd Normal Form (3NF) principles and includes primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and triggers for maintaining consistency.

Features:
✅ Books Management – Tracks book details, conditions, and availability.
✅ Membership System – Handles member registration, account status, and outstanding fines.
✅ Borrowing & Returns – Manages transactions, due dates, and automated fine calculations.
✅ Data Integrity – Enforces constraints to prevent inconsistencies.
✅ Privacy & Security – Implements access control and GDPR-compliant data handling.
✅ Realistic Test Data – Generated using Python (Faker, NumPy) to mimic real-world scenarios.

Tech Stack:
🗄️ Database: SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL
🐍 Data Generation: Python (Pandas, Faker, NumPy)
📊 Queries & Constraints: SQL
